<h1>Gates of Olympus</h1>
 <p>In this project, I created a browser-based arcade game inspired by classic brick-breaker games. The layout features a central canvas with interactive gameplay, themed graphics, and animated elements.</p>

Specifically, I:

<ul>
  <li>Set up the HTML structure with a flexible layout that includes the game canvas, control buttons, and themed visuals.</li>
  <li>Used the HTML5 <canvas> element to render game elements like the ball, slider, and collectible objects (crowns and sandwatches).</li>
  <li>Wrote JavaScript to control the game logic, including ball movement, collisions, win conditions, and object removal.</li>
  <li>Integrated images for a more immersive experience and used SweetAlert for custom popup alerts.</li>
  <li>Styled the page with CSS to align with the Gates of Olympus aesthetic, including glowing buttons, blurred backgrounds, and animations.</li>
</ul>
